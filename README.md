# Project One: geoSTORM 🌎⛈

Our mission: to create a fun and engaging app that encourages the user to learn a little more about the individual US States.

## Welcome to geoSTORM

The application begins with the user clicking on Start. Here they will decide the number of state they would like to guess.
The choice is 1 to 50!  Should you have confidence you are a master of the States attempt all 50!

* Should you chose to venture beyond to our Fun Facts page: Click a state for weird and interesting facts about all 50 states.
* News articles will also populate for selected State.
* We appreciate your interest!

## Screenshots

The suggestion is to include a screenshot of what the user can anticipate. 

## Thoughts: Inclusions

We reccomend you use Google Chrome to run this application.
