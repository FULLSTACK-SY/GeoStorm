# Project One: geoSTORM üåé‚õà

Our mission: to create a fun and engaging app that encourages the user to learn a little more about the individual US States.

## Welcome to geoSTORM

The application begins with the user clicking on Start. Here they will decide the number of questions they would like to answer.
The choice is 1 to 50!  Should you have confidence you are a master of the States.

* once we nail down page 2: update here.
* fancy fun things we'd like to include
* lets discuss what else we would like the user to know before they visit the page

## Screenshots

The suggestion is to include a screenshot of what the user can anticpate.  Do we want to include this?

## Thoughts: Inclusions

Here we can add some more information about how to navigate the project.  Does the user need to install anything, know anything special,
this can all be moved around.
